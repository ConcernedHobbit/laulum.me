I&#x27;m making a note here:
Huge success!

It&#x27;s hard to overstate
my satisfaction.

Aperture Science:
We do what we must
because we can
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there&#x27;s no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
&#x27;til you run out of cake.
And the science gets done.
And you make a neat gun
for the people who are
still alive.

I&#x27;m not even angry...
I&#x27;m being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart,
and killed me.

And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!

Now, these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we&#x27;re out of beta.
We&#x27;re releasing on time!
So I&#x27;m GLaD I got burned!
Think of all the things we learned!
for the people who are
still alive.

Go ahead and leave me...
I think I&#x27;d prefer to stay inside...
Maybe you&#x27;ll find someone else
to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance!

Anyway this cake is great!
It&#x27;s so delicious and moist!

Look at me: still talking
when there&#x27;s science to do!
When I look out there,
it makes me glad I&#x27;m not you.

I&#x27;ve experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are
still alive.
And believe me I am
still alive.
I&#x27;m doing science and I&#x27;m
still alive.
I feel fantastic and I&#x27;m
still alive.
While you&#x27;re dying I&#x27;ll be
still alive.
And when you&#x27;re dead I will be
still alive

Still alive.

Still alive.
