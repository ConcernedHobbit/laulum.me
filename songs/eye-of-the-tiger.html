Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I&#x27;m back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don&#x27;t lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It&#x27;s the eye of the tiger
It&#x27;s the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he&#x27;s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds still we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

It&#x27;s the eye of the tiger
It&#x27;s the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he&#x27;s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I&#x27;m not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It&#x27;s the eye of the tiger
It&#x27;s the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he&#x27;s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
