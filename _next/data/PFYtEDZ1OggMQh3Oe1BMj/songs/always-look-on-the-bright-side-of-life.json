{"pageProps":{"song":{"title":"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life","melody":"Monty Python","lyrics":"Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad\nOther things just make you swear and curse\nWhen you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble give a whistle\nThis will help things turn out for the best ...\n\nAnd ... Always look on the bright side of life ...\nAlways look on the light side of life ...\n\nIf life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten\nAnd that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing\nWhen you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly, chumps\nJust purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing\n\nAnd ... always look on the bright side of life ...\nAlways look on the light side of life ...\n\nFor life is quite absurd\nAnd death's the final word\nYou must always face the curtain with a bow.\nForget about your sin - give the audience a grin\nEnjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.\n\nSo, always look on the bright side of death\nJust before you draw your terminal breath\n\nLife's a piece of shit\nWhen you look at it\nLife's a laugh and death's the joke, it's true\nYou'll see it's all a show\nKeep 'em laughing as you go\nJust remember that the last laugh is on you\n\nAlways look on the bright side of life ...\nAnd always look on the right side of life ...\n(Come on guys, cheer up!)\nAlways look on the bright side of life ...\nAnd always look on the right side of life ...\n(Worse things happen at sea, you know.)\nAlways look on the bright side of life ...\n(I mean - what have you got to lose?)\n(You know, you come from nothing -\nyou're going back to nothing.\nWhat have you lost? Nothing!)\nAlways look on the right side of life ...\n","filename":"always_look_on_the_bright_side_of_life.md"}},"__N_SSG":true}
