{"pageProps":{"song":{"title":"Jallulujah","melody":"Hallelujah","lyrics":"I heard there was a single star\nThat shines so brightly from afar\nThe evening young\nThe party just beginning\nWe came up to the open doors\nThe tables set on the party floors\nNow in the glasses pour the Jaloviina\n\nJaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina\n\nThis seems familiar, let me think\nI’ve sung these songs and I’ve drunk this drink\nI used to sing alone before I came here\nI turn my head to left to right\nMy comrades are a joyful sight\nSo in our glasses raise the Jaloviina\n\nJaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina\n\nIt’s late but not yet time for bed\nYou gently rest your weary head\nAnd close your eyes as dreams they overcome you\nYour comrades hear you loudly snore\nDecide that they can take no more\nSo on your lips they pour the Jaloviina\n\n:,: Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina :,:\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
