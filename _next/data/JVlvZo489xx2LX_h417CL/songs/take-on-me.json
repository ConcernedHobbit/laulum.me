OK?\n\nTake on me (take on me)\nTake me on (take on me)\nI'll be gone\nIn a day or two\n\nSo needless to say\nOf odds and ends\nBut I'll be stumbling away\nSlowly learning that life is OK.\nSay after me,\n\"It's no better to be safe than sorry.\"\n\nTake on me (take on me)\nTake me on (take on me)\nI'll be gone\nIn a day or two\n\nOh, things that you say. Yeah.\nIs it life or just to play my worries away?\nYou're all the things I've got to remember\nYou're shying away\nI'll be coming for you anyway\n\nTake on me (take on me)\nTake me on (take on me)\nI'll be gone\nIn a day\n\nI'll be gone (take on me)\nIn a day\n","slug":"take-on-me"}},"__N_SSG":true}
